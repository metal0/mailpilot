# Quick Start Guide

Get Mailpilot processing your emails in just 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

- ✅ Node.js 22+ installed
- ✅ An email account with IMAP access
- ✅ An LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Ollama running locally)

## Step 1: Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metal0/mailpilot.git
cd mailpilot
pnpm install
```

## Step 2: Create Configuration

Copy the example configuration:

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

Edit `config.yaml` with this minimal setup:

```yaml
llm_providers:
  - name: openai
    api_url: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
    default_model: gpt-4o-mini

accounts:
  - name: personal
    imap:
      host: imap.gmail.com
      port: 993
      username: ${GMAIL_USER}
      password: ${GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD}

    folders:
      - name: INBOX
        llm_provider: openai
        prompt: |
          Classify this email into ONE of these categories:
          - important: Urgent emails requiring immediate attention
          - newsletters: Marketing and promotional emails
          - social: Social media notifications
          - receipts: Purchase confirmations and receipts
          - spam: Unwanted or suspicious emails

          Return your classification as JSON:
          {
            "action": "move",
            "folder": "category-name",
            "confidence": 0.95
          }
```

## Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or export variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export GMAIL_USER="you@gmail.com"
export GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD="xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx"
```

<Callout type="info">
**Gmail App Password**: You need to generate an app password from your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), not your regular password.
</Callout>

## Step 4: Build and Run

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

You should see output like:

```
[INFO] Mailpilot starting...
[INFO] Dashboard available at http://localhost:8080
[INFO] Connecting to IMAP: imap.gmail.com
[INFO] Processing folder: INBOX (15 unread messages)
```

## Step 5: Access the Dashboard

Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`

The dashboard shows:
- **Activity Feed**: Recent email classifications
- **Statistics**: Processing metrics
- **Health Status**: IMAP and LLM provider status
- **Testing Sandbox**: Test your prompts safely

## Step 6: Test Your Rules

Before processing real emails, test your classification prompt:

1. Go to **Testing Sandbox** in the dashboard
2. Paste a sample email
3. Click **Test Classification**
4. Review the LLM's response

Adjust your prompt until you get consistent, accurate classifications.

## Example Classification Results

After running for a few minutes, you should see emails automatically:

- Moved to appropriate folders (`important`, `newsletters`, etc.)
- Flagged based on importance
- Marked as read if specified

## What's Happening?

Mailpilot is:

1. **Connecting** to your IMAP server via TLS
2. **Fetching** unread emails from INBOX
3. **Classifying** each email using your LLM prompt
4. **Applying actions** (move, flag, read) based on the classification
5. **Logging** all activity to the dashboard

## Common Issues

### "Authentication failed"

- **Gmail**: Make sure you're using an [app password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), not your regular password
- **Outlook**: You need to [enable IMAP access](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/pop-imap-and-smtp-settings-8361e398-8af4-4e97-b147-6c6c4ac95353) first

### "LLM provider error"

- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your API usage limits
- Ensure `api_url` points to the correct endpoint

### "No emails processed"

- Check that you have unread emails in INBOX
- Verify IMAP connection in dashboard health status
- Check logs for specific errors
