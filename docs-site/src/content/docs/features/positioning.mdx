# Philosophy & Positioning

Mailpilot is an open-source, self-hosted email processing daemon that uses AI to automatically organize and manage your inbox.

## Core Principles

### 1. Privacy First

**Your email stays on your server.**

- All processing happens locally on your infrastructure
- No email content is sent to third-party services (except your chosen LLM provider)
- Full control over data retention and audit logs
- IMAP credentials never leave your server

Unlike cloud email services, Mailpilot operates as a self-hosted daemon that connects directly to your email provider using standard IMAP.

### 2. LLM-Powered Intelligence

**Modern AI, not rule-based filters.**

Traditional email filters use rigid rules:
```
If sender = "newsletter@example.com" then move to "Newsletters"
```

Mailpilot uses Large Language Models to understand context:
```
"This is a promotional email from a SaaS vendor offering a discount.
File under Marketing/SaaS Offers for review later."
```

The LLM considers:
- **Sender reputation and patterns**
- **Email content and intent**
- **Urgency and importance signals**
- **Your custom classification preferences**

### 3. Open Source

**Transparent, auditable, extensible.**

Mailpilot is MIT-licensed open-source software:

- **No vendor lock-in**: Host it anywhere
- **Full transparency**: Audit the code yourself
- **Community-driven**: Contributions welcome
- **No usage limits**: Process unlimited emails

The codebase is designed for:
- Easy self-hosting (Docker, systemd, or bare metal)
- Clear documentation
- Minimal dependencies
- Production-ready stability

### 4. Local or API LLMs

**Choose your AI provider.**

Mailpilot supports both cloud APIs and local models:

**Cloud APIs** (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter):
- State-of-the-art performance
- Pay per token
- Fast classification
- No local GPU required

**Local Models** (Ollama, llama.cpp):
- Complete privacy - no external API calls
- One-time cost (hardware)
- Unlimited processing
- Requires GPU for best performance

Mix and match providers per account or folder.

## Design Philosophy

### Daemon, Not SaaS

Mailpilot is a **background daemon**, not a web application:

- Runs continuously in the background
- Watches IMAP folders for new emails
- Processes automatically without user interaction
- Web dashboard for monitoring only (optional)

This design prioritizes:
- **Reliability**: No internet connection to a SaaS platform required
- **Performance**: Local processing, minimal latency
- **Privacy**: All data stays on your infrastructure

### Configuration Over UI

Mailpilot uses **YAML configuration** with an optional UI:

```yaml
accounts:
  - name: personal
    folders:
      - name: INBOX
        prompt: |
          Classify personal email intelligently...
```

**Why YAML?**
- Version control friendly (git diff, rollback)
- Programmatically editable (CI/CD, templating)
- Explicit and auditable
- Portable across environments

The web dashboard provides a **visual configuration editor** for those who prefer GUIs, but the source of truth is always the YAML file.

### Prompts Are First-Class

**You control the classification logic.**

Mailpilot doesn't impose a classification scheme. Instead, you write prompts that teach the LLM your preferences:

```yaml
prompt: |
  VIP senders (always flag and keep in INBOX):
  - boss@company.com
  - ceo@company.com

  Rules:
  - GitHub notifications: move to "GitHub/{repo}"
  - Marketing emails: move to "Newsletters"
  - Meeting invites: keep in INBOX
```

This approach enables:
- **Infinite flexibility**: Classify however you want
- **Continuous improvement**: Refine prompts over time
- **Context-aware decisions**: LLMs understand nuance

### Battle-Tested Components

Mailpilot builds on proven technologies:

- **Node.js**: Mature runtime with excellent library ecosystem
- **IMAP protocol**: Universal email access standard
- **SQLite**: Reliable embedded database
- **Apache Tika**: Industry-standard document processing
- **ClamAV**: Open-source antivirus with daily updates

No bleeding-edge experiments. Just solid, production-ready software.

## Unique Value Proposition

### What Mailpilot Does Differently

**1. Intelligent Classification at Scale**

Process thousands of emails per day with LLM-powered understanding, not regex patterns.

**2. Self-Hosted Control**

You own the infrastructure, the data, and the processing logic.

**3. Provider Flexibility**

Switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or local models without changing your workflows.

**4. Real-Time Processing**

IMAP IDLE support means instant processing as emails arrive (when supported by your provider).

**5. Transparent Operations**

Full audit logs, processing headers, and configurable webhooks let you see exactly what happened to each email.

**6. Developer-Friendly**

RESTful API, webhook integrations, and SQLite database make it easy to build on top of Mailpilot.

## Who Is Mailpilot For?

### Ideal Users

- **Privacy-conscious individuals** who want local email processing
- **Power users** with complex email workflows
- **Developers** who need programmatic email organization
- **Small businesses** managing multiple accounts
- **Self-hosters** who prefer running their own infrastructure

### Not Ideal For

- Users expecting a fully managed SaaS solution
- Those uncomfortable with YAML configuration
- Users without basic server administration skills
- Anyone needing a mobile-first email client

## Comparison to Alternatives

### vs. Gmail Filters

**Gmail Filters**:
- Limited to exact string matching and sender rules
- No understanding of context or intent
- Manual rule creation for each pattern

**Mailpilot**:
- LLM-powered semantic understanding
- Context-aware classification
- Natural language prompts define behavior

### vs. Email Clients with AI Features

**Email Clients** (Superhuman, HEY, etc.):
- Proprietary, cloud-hosted
- Vendor lock-in
- Limited customization

**Mailpilot**:
- Open-source, self-hosted
- Full control over logic
- Mix any LLM provider

### vs. Custom Scripts

**Custom Scripts**:
- Brittle regex patterns
- High maintenance burden
- No semantic understanding

**Mailpilot**:
- LLM handles edge cases
- Prompt refinement vs. code changes
- Production-ready reliability

## Future Direction

Mailpilot is actively developed with a focus on:

- **Enhanced LLM integrations**: More providers, better vision support
- **Advanced automation**: Conditional workflows, multi-step actions
- **Improved observability**: Better debugging and monitoring tools
- **Performance optimization**: Faster processing, lower resource usage
